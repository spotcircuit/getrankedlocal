```typescript
const [aov, setAov] = useState(350); // Change average customer value
```

### Add More Testimonials
Edit `components/SocialProof.tsx`:
```typescript
const testimonials = [
  // Add your clients here
];
```

## üåê Production Deployment

### Build for Production
```powershell
npm run build
# or: .\build.bat
```

### Start Production Server
```powershell
npm run start
# or: .\start-prod.bat
```

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel
```

## üîë Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` (never commit). See `.env.example` for the shape.

- `DATABASE_URL` (optional) ‚Äî PostgreSQL connection string used by API features.
  - Format: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require`
  - If unset, the site still runs; API-backed features may be limited.

## üîé Key Routes

- `/` ‚Äî Homepage with "Browse Med Spas by Location", social proof, and CTAs.
- `/getrankedlocal` ‚Äî Get Ranked Local page with hero form, CTA, breadcrumbs, and lead capture modal.
- `/grid-test` ‚Äî Grid Search Analysis interface with dual search modes, real-time visualization, and competitor heat map switching.
- `/[state]`, `/[state]/[city]`, etc. ‚Äî Dynamic directories.

## üìä Tracking & Analytics

The app tracks:
- Page views
- Calculator interactions
- CTA clicks
- Form submissions

View analytics in your Vercel dashboard.

## üîó Integration with Your Data

The app can pull real data from your scraped businesses:

1. Start the API backend
2. Pass business ID in URL: `?id=123`
3. API fetches from your database
4. Shows personalized competitive analysis

## üìà Conversion Optimization Tips

1. **Send personalized URLs** in cold emails via ReachInbox
2. **Track opens** to see who's interested
3. **Follow up** immediately when they view the calculator
4. **A/B test** different pain points and urgency messages
5. **Use retargeting** pixels for visitors who don't convert

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### CSS Issues
The app uses manual CSS for compatibility. Edit `app/globals.css` for style changes.

### Images Not Loading
Ensure images are in `public/images/` folder.

### API Connection Failed
Check that Python backend is running on port 8000.

### Build Warning about Dynamic Route
If you see a Next.js message about dynamic server usage for `/api/analyze`, it's expected when that route inspects `request.url`. This does not block the build.
